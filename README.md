# Verzerrer-Mixer

A script to progressively overlay an image on a video captured using the [verzerrer](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/verzerrer) effect on TikTok. It is written in Python and uses OpenCV for image processing.

One possible use case is creating videos for the [renaissance trend](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/renaissance) on TikTok. The script works best if the video was filmed in front of a plain, light background.
